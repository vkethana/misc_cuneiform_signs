Proto-cuneiform sign list

The `archsigns` consist of JPG files of archaic cuneiform signs which were orginally the work of Robert K. Englund and therefore is copyrighted to him. But according to his wishes, of making his work freely accessible for reuse, the CC BY 4.0 license was added to this repo, making it possible for us to add these signs to Wikidata.
The `oraccsigns` consist of PNG files of signs from the LAK sign list, and we were given permision to convert them to SVG by Stephen J. Tinney from the [ORACC Global Sign List](https://github.com/oracc/ogsl]).
# SVG Conversion
The folder `svg_archsigns` contains SVG versions of all of the signs. The code used to perform this conversion task is in `script.py`. The SVGs are fully transparent and were made using potrace and ImgMagick. Make sure these two tools are installed before running the code.
